Research project exploring the use of LLMs and TaskLang to generate knowledge graphs in Neo4j from recipe data.

# Recipe Knowledge Graph with LLMs and TaskLang

This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured data from recipes and construct knowledge graphs using Neo4j.

## Objectives
- Investigate prompt engineering strategies for generating RDF.
- Evaluate the consistency and quality of knowledge graphs with and without TaskLang.
- Test reverse generation: producing recipes from RDF graphs.

## Structure
- `prompts/`: All prompts used during the experiments.
- `rdf_outputs/`: RDF files generated by the LLMs.
- `screenshots/`: Knowledge graph visuals from Neo4j.
- `slides/`: Final presentation and documentation.

## Tools Used
- Neo4j (for graph creation and visualization)
- OpenAI ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral, Perplexity (for generation)
- TaskLang (prompt templating language)
