RECIPE
Easy Seafood
Burgers
Ready in 10 minutes
Serves 4 people
Ingredients
● 1 can (170g) tuna or can (7 ½ oz/213g)
salmon, drained (if using salmon, remove
skin and large bones)
● ¼ cup (60mL) celery, finely chopped
● 2 Tbsp (30mL) relish or chopped pickles
● 2 eggs, lightly beaten
● ½ cup (125mL) bread crumbs
● 2 green onions, chopped
● Salt and pepper to taste
Tips
This recipe makes 4 small patties and tastes
just as delicious with canned salmon.
Serve on whole wheat toast, bannock, or a
bun.

Preparation
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine all
ingredients.
2. Shape into 4 patties.
3. Turn on the stove to medium-high
heat. In a non-stick pan, cook patties
until both sides are golden brown -
about 3 minutes per side.
